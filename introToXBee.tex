\chapter{Introduction to XBee}

One of the main characteristics of WSNs is the ability each node has to wirelessly communicate with other nodes. 
This is commonly performed with ZigBee compliant radios, like XBee~\cite{faludi2010bws}.

Throughout this section you will be introduced to the different components and code that will allow you to set a basic wireless network with XBee modules.

\section{The XBee module hardware configuration}\label{xbee:hardware}

Xbee modules come in different configurations. The will be using is called XBee-Series 2 with wire antenna and it is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xbee}.
